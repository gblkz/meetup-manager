                    <br/>
                    We are always looking for speakers! 
                    Presentations should be technical in nature and
                    show members how to use AWS, 
                    explain best practices, or show cutting edge solutions
                    being developed on AWS.
                    Find out what members are interested in 
                    hearing about by reviewing member profiles on 
                    Meet Up. Some topics include
                    distributed architecture, 
                    scalability, best practices,
                    databases, security and service specific topics.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Members who want to give short presentations
                    at AWS events are welcome to do so.
                    If we have enough members we can do a full
                    meet up of member presentations, 10-15 minutes,
                    or members can present before our main presentation.
