Members requested that we please use microphones because they couldn't hear at the first event. Additionally, we had AV problems so here are the specifications:
<br/><br/>
There are two wired microphones, but no wireless mic. We have an HDMI hookup to the projector, and also an HDMI to Mac converter. The mixing board (sound) has a laptop hookup as well.
<br/><br/>
There are two couches on the stage as you can see in the photos on meet up. Speakers often opt to stand and hold mics with laptop on table.
<br/><br/>
We have had issues with a/v equipment so if you can come early to test it out and send a copy to Teri Radichel as a backup is best. This is also good so we can post a copy of the presentation on our site after the meet up.
<br/><br/>
Meet ups are sometimes video taped and put on our web site.

<b>Presentations</b>
<br/>
<br/>
We are always looking for speakers!
Presentations should be technical in nature and
show members how to use AWS,
explain best practices, or show cutting edge solutions
being developed on AWS.
Find out what members are interested in
hearing about by reviewing member profiles on
Meet Up. Some topics include
distributed architecture,
scalability, best practices,
databases, security and service specific topics.
<br/><br/>
Members who want to give short presentations
at AWS events are welcome to do so.
If we have enough members we can do a full
meet up of member presentations, 10-15 minutes,
or members can present before our main presentation.
