Meetup Manager App

AWS folder has code run on AWS

    * exploring use of Lambda as endpoints for application calls to trigger various actions

    * static web site stored in S3 - want to add ability to load data from meetup dynamcially from meetup API if possible on home page to show current and past events

iOS folder has iPhone app

    * all it does now - run it (Product | Run in Xcode on Mac) and push the red button. Woohoo.
